### Technologies
* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. 
* [Dart](https://dart.dev/) - Dart is a client-optimized programming language for apps on multiple platforms. It is developed by Google and is used to build mobile, desktop, backend and web applications. Dart is an object-oriented, class defined, garbage-collected language using a C-style syntax that transcompiles optionally into JavaScript.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control and GitHub, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.
* [Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) - CNNs are regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons. Multilayer perceptrons usually mean fully connected networks, that is, each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. The "fully-connectedness" of these networks makes them prone to overfitting data. Typical ways of regularization include adding some form of magnitude measurement of weights to the loss function. CNNs take a different approach towards regularization: they take advantage of the hierarchical pattern in data and assemble more complex patterns using smaller and simpler patterns. Therefore, on the scale of connectedness and complexity, CNNs are on the lower extreme.
