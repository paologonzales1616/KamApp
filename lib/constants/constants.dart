const List<String> DESCRIPTION = [
  "Early blight overwinters on infected plant tissue and is spread by splashing rain, irrigation, insects and garden tools. The disease is also carried on tomato seeds and in potato tubers. It can be caused by two different closely related fungi, Alternaria tomatophila and Alternaria solani. Alternaria tomatophila is more virulent on tomato than A. solani, so in regions where A. tomatophila is found, it is the primary cause of early blight on tomato. However, if A. tomatophila is absent, A. solani will cause early blight on tomato.",
  "Late blight first appears on the lower, older leaves as water-soaked, gray-green spots. As the disease matures, these spots darken and a white fungal growth forms on the undersides. Eventually the entire plant will become infected. Crops can be severely damaged",
  "Found in greenhouses, home gardens and landscaped areas across the country, leafminers are the larval (maggot) stage of an insect family that feeds between the upper and lower surfaces of leaves. On heavily infested plants it is not uncommon to find 6 or more maggots per leaf. Although damage can restrict plant growth, resulting in reduced yields and loss of vigor, healthy plants can tolerate considerable injury. Host plants include beans, blackberries, cabbage, lettuce, peppers, and a variety of ornamental flowers, citrus trees and shrubs.",
  "Leaf mold appear usually with foliage, but fruit infection is rare. The primary symptom appear on the upper surface of infected leaves as a small spot pale green or yellowish with indefinite margins, and on corresponding area of the lower surface, the fungus begins to sporulate.[5] The diagnostic symptom develops on lower surface as an olive green to grayish purple and velvety appearance, which are composed of spores (conidia). Continuously, the color of the infected leaf changes to yellowish brown and the leaf begins to curl and dry. The leaves will drop upon reaching a premature stage, and the defoliation of the infected host will cause further infection. This disease develops well in relative humidity levels above 85%. When the temperature reaches optimum level for germinating, the host will be infected by the pathogen. Occasionally, this pathogen causes disease on the fruit or blossoms with various symptoms. Fruits such as green and ripe one will develop dark rot on the stem. The blossoms will be killed before fruits grow.",
  "Septoria leaf spot is caused by a fungus, Septoria lycopersici. It is one of the most destructive diseases of tomato foliage and is particularly severe in areas where wet, humid weather persists for extended periods. Septoria leaf spot usually appears on the lower leaves after the first fruit sets. Spots are circular, about 1/16 to 1/4 inch in diameter with dark brown margins and tan to gray centers with small black fruiting structures. Characteristically, there are many spots per leaf. This disease spreads upwards from oldest to youngest growth. If leaf lesions are numerous, the leaves turn slightly yellow, then brown, and then wither. Fruit infection is rare.",
  "Field symptoms consist of leaf wilting during periods of warm, dry weather or periods of moisture stress. Plants often recover during evening hours when temperatures are lower, but wilt again during the heat of the day. Infected plants in the Central High Plains have additionally exhibited symptoms consisting of wavy, interveinal, necrotic lesions surrounded by bright yellow borders. These symptoms may be confused with those caused by common bacterial blight pathogen, but bacterial wilt lesions are additionally accompanied by wilting and often mortality with severely infected plants.",
  "Wilt itself is the most common sign, with wilting of the stem and leaves occurring due to the blockage of the xylem vascular tissues and therefore reduced water and nutrient flow. In small plants and seedlings, Verticillium can quickly kill the plant while in larger, more developed plants the severity can vary. Some times only one side of the plant will appear infected because once in the vascular tissues, the disease migrates mostly upward and not as much radially in the stem. Other symptoms include stunting, chlorosis or yellowing of the leaves, necrosis or tissue death, and defoliation. Internal vascular tissue discoloration might be visible when the stem is cut.",
  "This virus is transmitted by an insect vector from the family Aleyrodidae and order Hemiptera, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, commonly known as the silverleaf whitefly or the sweet potato whitefly. TYLCV is transmitted by the insect vector Bemisia tabaci in a persistent-circulative nonpropagative manner. The virus can be efficiently transmitted during the adult stages. This virus transmission has a short acquisition access period of 15–20 minutes, and latent period of 8–24 hours. In this plant-virus and vector system, females are more effective than males transmitting the virus. A study demonstrated that TYLCV is transmitted to offspring for at least two generations.",
  "Bacterial spot is caused by four species of Xanthomonas and occurs worldwide wherever tomatoes are grown. Bacterial spot causes leaf and fruit spots, which leads to defoliation, sun-scalded fruit, and yield loss. Due to diversity within the bacterial spot pathogens, the disease can occur at different temperatures and is a threat to tomato production worldwide.",
  "Tomato Pith Necrosis is caused by Pseudomonas corrugata and other soil-borne species of Pseudomonas.  While high tunnels provide ideal conditions for the growth of early season tomatoes, this environment and traditional greenhouses also provide ideal conditions for a newly emerging disease of greenhouse tomatoes. This disease generally occurs on early planted tomatoes growing when night temperatures are cool, the humidity is high, and the plants are growing vigorously because of excessive levels of nitrogen. The disease is also associated with prolonged periods of cloudy, cool weather.",
  "Gray mold is caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea and is a common pathogen of nearly all plants, including tomato. Symptoms include light tan or gray spots on the leaves. These spots later become covered with a grayish-brown fungus. Ultimately the leaf collapses and dies. The fungus cause cankers on stems and kill flowers and fruit.",
  "Fusarium wilt on tomatoes is caused by Fusarium oxysporumsp. lycopersici. It is a soilborn fungus that is found throughout the United States, especially in warm regions of the country. The organism is specific for tomato and is very longlived in all regions of the United States. The disease develops more quickly in soils that are high in nitrogen and low in potassium. In addition, plants grown in sandy soils tend to contract this disease more often.",
  "Southern blight is not a common disease of tomatoes. High temperatures (above 85°F, 29°C) favor the disease, which occasionally causes damage to tomato crops. The fungus attacks a wide range of plants and survives for long periods in soil as sclerotia. Disease incidence and severity are dependent on the number of sclerotia in the soil.",
  "Tomato spotted wilt virus is transmitted by various species of thrips, including the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, the onion thrips, Thrips tabaci, and the chili thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis. Tomato spotted wilt virus also infects the thrips vector. Nymphs that acquire the virus by feeding on infected plants will retain the ability to transmit it for the remainder of their lives. Tomato spotted wilt virus cannot be passed from infected females through the eggs.\n\nThe virus has an extremely wide host range, including many weeds and ornamentals as well as crop hosts. It is one of the few plant viruses with a host range that includes dicots and monocots (e.g., tomatoes and onions).",
  "Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is a DNA virus from the genus Begomovirus and the family Geminiviridae. TYLCV causes the most destructive disease of tomato, and it can be found in tropical and subtropical regions causing severe economic losses. This virus is transmitted by an insect vector from the family Aleyrodidae and order Hemiptera, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, commonly known as the silverleaf whitefly or the sweet potato whitefly.",
  "Pith necrosis is caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas corrugata, which is considered a weak pathogen able to attack tomato plants that are growing too fast. It occurs primarily in greenhouses with affected plants randomly distributed. Symptoms typically develop when first fruit are close to mature green.",
  "Fusarium crown and root rot (FCRR) caused by Fusarium oxysporum Schlect f. sp. radicis-lycopersici Jarvis and Shoemaker (FORL) is one of the most damaging soil-borne diseases of tomato and becoming more common in greenhouse tomato production.",

const List<String> RECOMMENDATION = [
  "Use pathogen-free seed, or collect seed only from disease-free plants. Stake the plants to increase airflow around the plant and facilitate drying. Staking will also reduce contact between the leaves and spore-contaminated soil. Apply plastic or organic mulch to reduce humidity and provide a barrier between contaminated soil and leaves. In the fall, remove or bury infected plants to reduce the likelihood of the pathogen surviving to the following year. For greenhouse production, early blight has been reduced by as much as 50% by covering houses with UV-absorbing vinyl film.\n\nIt is important to alternate between different chemical families to avoid the development of pathogen insensitivity to particular active ingredients. Some insensitivity to the chemical family 11 has become more common in some areas, so particular care should be taken to rotate these with other chemical families. Also, if insensitivity is already present in a given field population of early blight, fungicides in chemical family 11 will not provide good control.",
  "If adequate field scouting occurs and late blight is found soon after disease development, localized patches of potato plants can be killed with a desiccant (e.g. paraquat) through the use of a backpack sprayer. This management technique can be thought of as a field-scale hypersensitive response similar to what occurs in some plant-viral interactions whereby cells surrounding the initial point of infection are killed in order to prevent proliferation of the pathogen.\n\nIf infected tubers make it into the storage bin, there's a very high risk to the storage life of that bin. Once in storage, there isn't much that can be done besides emptying the parts of the bin that contain tubers infected with Phytophthora infestans. To increase the probability of successfully storing potatoes from a field where late blight was known to occur during the growing season, some products can be applied just prior to entering storage (e.g. Phostrol). The problem with products being sprayed on tubers just prior to storage is that you are applying these products in an aqueous solution and high moisture carries a high risk of tuber breakdown due to wide range of pathogens.",
  "Monitor plant leaves closely. At the first sign of tunneling, squeeze the leaf at the tunnel between two fingers to crush any larvae. Done soon enough, this killing larvae can allow plants to survive minor outbreaks. Pick off and destroy badly infested leaves in small gardens. The more healthy the plant, the less chance that leafminers will hurt it. Maintain plant health with organic fertilizers and proper watering to allow plants to outgrow and tolerate pest damage. Keep your soil alive by using compost and other soil amendments. The parasitic wasp Diglyphus isaea is a commercially available beneficial insect that will kill leafminer larva in the mine. The wasp is especially beneficial to indoor growers of ornamentals and vegetables. Use yellow or blue sticky traps to catch egg laying adults. Cover soil under infested plants with plastic mulches to prevent larvae from reaching the ground and pupating.",
  "The disease management or control can be divided into two main groups: disease control in greenhouse and disease control in the field. Both controls are very similar. The differences are presented in few controls adopted in greenhouse in which some environmental conditions are controlled such as humidity and temperature as well sanitization of the greenhouse. The first strategy of management is the cultural practices for reducing the disease. It includes adequating row and plant spacing that promote better air circulation through the canopy reducing the humidity; preventing excessive nitrogen on fertilization since nitrogen out of balance enhances foliage disease development; keeping the relatively humidity below 85% (suitable on greenhouse), promote air circulation inside the greenhouse, early planting might to reduce the disease severity and seed treatment with hot water (25 minutes at 122 °F or 50 °C). The second strategy of management is the sanitization control in order to reduce the primary inoculum. Remove and destroy (burn) all plants debris after the harvest, scout for disease and rogue infected plants as soon as detected and steam sanitization the greenhouse between crops.",
  "If caught early, the lower infected leaves can be removed and burned or destroyed. However, removing leaves above where fruit has formed will weaken the plant and expose fruit to sunscald. At the end of the season, collect all foliage from infected plants and dispose of or bury. Do not compost diseased plants. If the plants can still be handled without breaking them, stake or cage the plants to raise them off the ground and promote faster drying of the foliage. Overhead watering facilitates infection and spreads the disease. Use a soaker hose at the base of the plant to keep the foliage dry. Water early in the day. Nightshade and horsenettle are frequently hosts of Septoria leaf spot and should be eradicated around the garden site.",
  "Field symptoms consist of leaf wilting during periods of warm, dry weather or periods of moisture stress. Plants often recover during evening hours when temperatures are lower, but wilt again during the heat of the day. Infected plants in the Central High Plains have additionally exhibited symptoms consisting of wavy, interveinal, necrotic lesions surrounded by bright yellow borders. These symptoms may be confused with those caused by common bacterial blight pathogen, but bacterial wilt lesions are additionally accompanied by wilting and often mortality with severely infected plants. Seed may be treated with streptomycin, which will help to achieve better initial stands, but will not protect for the entire season. Consider using copper-based sprays during mid-vegetative or early flowering periods, depending upon weather conditions.",
  "Verticillium wilt begins as a mild, local infection, which over a few years will grow in strength as more virile strains of the fungus develop. If left unchecked the disease will become so widespread that the crop will need to be replaced with resistant varieties, or a new crop will need to be planted altogether.\n\nControl of Verticillium can be achieved by planting disease–free plants in uncontaminated soil, planting resistant varieties, and refraining from planting susceptible crops in areas that have been used repeatedly for solanaceous crops. Soil fumigation can also be used, with chloropicrin being particularly effective in reducing disease incidence in contaminated fields.\n\nIn tomato plants, the presence of ethylene during the initial stages of infection inhibits disease development, while in later stages of disease development the same hormone will cause greater wilt. Tomato plants are available that have been engineered with resistant genes that will tolerate the fungus while showing significantly lower signs of wilting.\n\nVerticillium albo-altrum, Verticilium dahliae and V. longisporum can overwinter as melanized mycelium or microsclerotia within live vegetation or plant debris. As a result, it can be important to clear plant debris to lower the spread of disease. Verticilium dahliae and V. longisporum are able to survive as microsclerotia in soil for up to 15 years.\n\nSusceptible tomato seedlings inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and Trichoderma Harzianum show increased resistance towards Verticillium wilt.",
  "Currently, the most effective treatments used to control the spread of TYLCV are insecticides and resistant crop varieties. The effectiveness of insecticides is not optimal in tropical areas due to whitefly resistance against the insecticides; therefore, insecticides should be alternated or mixed to provide the most effective treatment against virus transmission. Developing countries experience the most significant losses due to TYLCV infections due to the warm climate as well as the expensive costs of insecticides used as the control strategy. Other methods to control the spread of TYLCV include planting resistant/tolerant lines, crop rotation, and breeding for resistance of TYLCV. As with many other plant viruses, one of the most promising methods to control TYLCV is the production of transgenic tomato plants resistant to TYLCV.",
  "Bacterial spot occurs commonly in tomatoes. Using pathogen-free seed and disease-free transplants, when possible, is the best way to avoid bacterial spot on tomato. Avoiding sprinkler irrigation and cull piles near greenhouse or field operations, and rotating with a nonhost crop also helps control the disease.\n\nCopper-containing bactericides provide partial disease control. Apply at first sign of disease and repeat at 10- to 14-day intervals when warm, moist conditions prevail. Copper is strictly a protectant and must be applied before an infection period occurs.",
  "There is no effective treatment for this disease; however, affected plants may recover if environmental conditions improve (warm, sunny weather).",
  "If gray mold is a known problem in your region, preventative applications of a fungicide may help. Clemson University's Cooperative Extension program recommends applying a product that contains chlorothalonil. Follow package directions before applying the spray. For example, a typical product calls for mixing 6 teaspoons of the fungicidal concentrate with one gallon of water, assuming a tomato patch that is about 200 square feet. Spray the plants thoroughly, focusing on the stems and leaves. You can repeat the applications about once a week, with a total of no more than seven applications.",
  "Remove infected plants from the garden. Removal of infected plants will help limit the disease's spread. Soil sterilization or fumigation will eliminate wilt fungi from the soil but are impractical for home gardeners. Soil replacement should be considered.\n\nAvoid over-application of high nitrogen fertilizers. High soil nitrogen levels accompanied by low potassium levels can increase susceptibility to the fungus. Use a soil test to determine potassium levels and other nutrient deficiencies.",
  "Southern blight can be difficult to manage when inoculum density is high and environmental conditions favor disease development. However, losses can be reduced by adopting the following management strategies:Avoid planting in fields with a history of southern blight.Rotate host crops with corn, wheat, barley, or other non-host crops to reduce inoculum levels in soil.Modify planting dates to avoid conditions that favor disease development, when possible.Inoculum levels can be reduced by burying infected plant debris and sclerotia via deep plowing to invert the soil.Ensure the previous crop is decomposed prior to planting. This may require disking the field several times in the fall and in the spring.Remove symptomatic plants and reduce or eliminate weed populations. Maintain adequate soil pH for optimum plant growth. Lower soil pH will encourage disease.",
  "Avoid planting near crops infected with Tomato spotted wilt virus. Monitor for thrips and tomato spotted wilt symptoms. If thrips are present and symptoms are observed, manage thrips to minimize the spread of the virus within the field. Consider removing infected plants at the seedling stage. Control weeds in and around fields.",
  "Treatments that are commonly used for this disease include insecticides, hybrid seeds, and growing tomatoes under greenhouse conditions. Currently, the most effective treatments used to control the spread of TYLCV are insecticides and resistant crop varieties. The effectiveness of insecticides is not optimal in tropical areas due to whitefly resistance against the insecticides; therefore, insecticides should be alternated or mixed to provide the most effective treatment against virus transmission.",
  "As with many bacterial tomato diseases, there is no effective treatment for pith necrosis. Plants may recover on their own however, as the weather warms and becomes sunnier. Potted plants in greenhouses should be moved outside to reduce humidity and improve ventilation.",
  "There are no fungicides to control Fusarium crown rot.  Most fungicides are for foliar use; no fungicides that may be sprayed on the top of the soil."

  "Cutworm is the name used for the larvae of a number of species of adult moths. Eggs that hatch in the fall can produce larvae capable of overwintering in the soil or a woodpile. They do the most damage early in the gardening season, when they emerge from hibernation. Cutworms are caterpillars, but they are often mistaken for the grubs of beetles such as Japanese beetles (which are damaging in their own right).\n\nBlack cutworms, also known as Agrotis ipsilon, are some of the most common cutworms. They have small dark spots on their bodies and mature into the dark sword-grass moth. Variegated cutworms, another common species, are mottled brown and have a faint white stripe down their backs.",
  "Whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) is a sap-sucking insect that is often found in thick crowds on the undersides of leaves.Tiny whiteflies can kill off tomato plants if they aren't promptly identified and treated. These small yellow-bodied insects have white wings, which they hold flat to their bodies or slightly tented. They feed on the underside of tomato leaves, sucking out sap and weakening the plant",
  "Tomato hornworms are very large caterpillars that have a '"

  "Stink bugs and leaf-footed bugs have long mouthparts they use to pierce tomato leaves, stems and fruit. The length of the structure depends on the size of the insect. After penetrating tomato plants and fruit, the insects suck out the juices. If they encounter seeds, they inject digestive enzymes to dissolve them.",
  "Tomato leaf miner larvae feed on the cells within tomato leaves and create silvery lines across the infested leaves. In low numbers, tomato leaf miner damage is usually cosmetic, however severe infestations will reduce the photosynthetic capabilities of the plant and reduce its vigour and yields.\n\nThe adult tomato leaf miner is a small dark-coloured fly with a yellow dot on its back, approximately 4mm in length. The female flies make small puncture marks usually around the edges of tomato leaves in order to feed and lay eggs. Eggs hatch into maggots that burrow under the leaf surface creating tunnels as they feed and grow. At the end of their mining, the maggots usually exit the leaf and turn into small brown-black pupae on the leaf surface or fall to the ground."

  "Whitefly damage plants by sucking the juices from new growth causing stunted growth, leaf yellowing and reduced yields. Plants become weak and susceptible to disease. Like aphids, whiteflies secrete honeydew, so leaves maybe sticky or covered with a black sooty mold. They are also responsible for transmitting several plant viruses.",
